# ThermRes-Seagrass
This repository contains the raw data and code for the following study: Leaf-size effects on the thermal resilience of two temperate seagrass species

It is structured into five folders, based on the four measured response variables (growth, photosynthetic rates, leaf nutrients and pigment concentrations) and a folder containing data used during the experimental setup. Each folder contains the measured raw data and the annotated code used to analyse and plot the respective data.
